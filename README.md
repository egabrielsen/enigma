# Enigma
A c++ program that encrypts text files by using 3 "rotors" modeled after Alan Turing's Enigma machine used in WWII

#How to use
Compile with g++ or gcc <br>
  <code>g++ *.cpp</code>
  
Open a shell: <br>
  Just run <code> ./a.out </code> to open an interactive shell <br>
  Type <code> exit </code> to exit
  
Encripting a file:<br>
  <code> ./a.out \<file to encript\> </code> <br>
  follow the steps that follow to encript. You must specify a key to encript the file. This will be the enigma key that is used to cipher the encription
  
decipher a file: <br>
  -> You must know the 3 capital letter enigma code in order to decipher text.<br>
  <code> ./a.out \<file to decipher\> </code> <br>
  -> then follow the steps to decipher
