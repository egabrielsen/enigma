CHAPTER 9: FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS

THIS CHAPTER BEGINS WITH EXPLAINING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNICATING INFORMATION EFFECTIVELY AND CLEARLY.  IT IS GOOD FOR THE USERS INCLUDING MANAGERS, CREDITORS, AND STOCKHOLDERS, AND IT ALSO HELPS THEM IN MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS.  HOWEVER TOO MUCH INFORMATION CAN BE A INFORMATION OVERLOAD AND LEAD TO OBSCURED TRIVIAL INFORMATION.  THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT WAYS OF DATA ANALYSIS WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING. THE FIRST, HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS, REFERS TO STUDYING THE BEHAVIOR F INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT ITEMS OVER SEVERAL ACCOUNTING PERIODS. WHEN USING HORIZONTAL ANALYSIS ONE WILL COME INTO CONTACT WITH ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS, OR MATERIALITY.  THE SECOND APPROACH IS CALLED PERCENTAGE ANALYSIS WHICH COMPARES TWO YEARS NUMBERS AS A PERCENTAGE.  THE THIRD APPROACH IS VERTICAL ANALYSIS, WHICH IS USED TO COMPARE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO A KEY STATEMENT FIGURE.  RATIO ANALYSIS IS ALSO USED.  IT INVOLVES STUDYING VARIOUS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DIFFERENT ITEMS REPORTED IN A SET OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
	MEASURING DEBT-PAYING CAN BE DONE SEVERAL WAYS AS WELL. LIQUIDITY RATIOS INDICATE A COMPANY’S ABILITY TO PAY SHORT-TERM DEBTS. TO FIND THE CURRENT RATIO YOU TAKE THE CURRENT ASSETS AND DIVIDE THEM BY CURRENT LIABILITIES. BY SUBTRACTING CURRENT LIABILITIES FROM CURRENT ASSETS YOU ACHIEVE THE WORKING CAPITAL.  A QUICK RATIO IS A CONSERVATIVE VARIATION OF THE CURRENT RATIO.  YOU TAKE THE QUICK ASSETS AND DIVIDE BY CURRENT LIABILITIES TO RECEIVE THE RATIO.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RATIOS ARE ACHIEVED BY NET CREDIT SALE DIVIDED BY AVERAGE ACCOUNTS RECEIVED.
	ANOTHER BIG TOPIC IN THIS CHAPTER IS THE MEASUREMENT OF PROFITABILITY. THIS IS HUGE FOR COMPANIES AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF CORPORATIONS. NET MARGIN IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET SALES FROM NET INCOME. ONE CAN ALSO COME UP WITH THE ASSET TURNOVER, WHICH MEASURES HOW MANY SALES DOLLARS WERE GENERATED FOR EACH DOLLAR OF ASSETS INVESTED. THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT (ROI) IS NET INCOME/ AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS. RETURN ON EQUITY (ROI) IS OFTEN USED TO MEASURE THE PROFITABILITY OF STOCKHOLDERS BY TAKING THE NET INCOME AND DIVIDING IT BY AVERAGE TOTAL STOCKHOLDER EQUITY.
	USERS CALCULATE RATIOS TO MEASURE A COMPANY’S LIQUIDITY, SOLVENCY, AND PROFITABILITY.  USERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS, DIFFERING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MANY OTHER FACTORS TO PRODUCE REPORTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
